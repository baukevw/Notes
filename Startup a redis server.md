##Starting a redis server

1. Download and install Redis server to your local system and server.

With Homebrew: 

> brew install redis

On Ubuntu: Follow this tutorial: [Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-redis)

Once installed install a nodejs server to your own project. You can use a sample server. We also need to install Foreman.

> gem install foreman

> git clone git://github.com/mikeatlas/realtime-server.git

> cd realtime-server

> sudo npm install

> foreman start
